STEP #1 - Create a account on Terraform Cloud - https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform

STEP #2 - In your local machine

# mkdir ~/testing-cloud
# cd testing-cloud
# vim main.tf
-------
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.16"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 1.2.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  region  = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-074dc0a6f6c764218"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
     Name = "app-server"
  }
}

-----
# terraform init
# terraform apply
### This will create the resource and the state file will be in your local storage.

STEP #3 - Login in your terraform cloud account and create a organisation and a workspace called "testing-tc". 
          URL to workspace - https://app.terraform.io/app/<your-organisation>/workspaces

STEP #4 - Change your main.tf and add a "cloud" block
# vim main.tf
-----

terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "your-organization"
    workspaces {
      name = "your-workspace"
    }
  }
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.16"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 1.2.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  region  = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-074dc0a6f6c764218"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
     Name = "app-server"
  }
}

-----

STEP #5 - Login to terraform

# terraform login
<read carefully, follow the steps>
<you will be asked to create your token and you will see a message like this>
####
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open the following URL to access the tokens page for app.terraform.io:
    https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens?source=terraform-login


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
####
Complete the login process.

STEP #6 - Initialize the terraform

# terraform init
<by this time your state file has moved to terraform cloud, so you can, if you wish remove the local state file>

STEP #7 - Set workspace variables
Navigate to your workspace in Terraform Cloud and go to the workspace's Variables page. 
Under Workspace Variables, add your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as Environment Variables, 
making sure to mark them as "Sensitive".

STEP #8 - Apply configuration

# terraform apply

Terraform is now storing your state remotely in Terraform Cloud. 
Remote state storage makes collaboration easier and keeps state and secret information off your local disk. 
Remote state is loaded only in memory when it is used.

STEP #9 - Destroy

# terraform destroy
