### terraform init
### now check the lock file - terraform.lock.hcl
### As a best practice always include lock file for your VCS
### 
### You can upgrade all providers - terraform init --upgrade
### now check the lock file
###
### warning - you might get errors while apply as certain options / parameters
###           might be deprecated. So check

### There are multiple arguments for specifying the version number. It’s probably a good idea to know
### these:
### • >= 1.41.0 is greater than or equal to the version.
### • <= 1.41.0 is less than or equal to the version.
### • ∼> 1.41.0 this one is funky. It means any version in the 1.41.X range.
### • >= 1.20, <= 1.41 is any version between 1.20 and 1.41 inclusive.

### One of the more common arguments is ∼> which is meant to keep you on the same major version,
### while still allowing for minor version updates. For instance, let’s say there’s major change coming
### to the Azure provider in version 2.0. By setting the version to ∼>1.0, you would allow all version 1
### updates that come down while still blocking the big 2.0 release.
